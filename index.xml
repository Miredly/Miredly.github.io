      <description>What better way to explore posting with Hugo than to post /about/ Hugo? After spending three weeks learning Flask, I decided to take a quick break and try out Hugo, a static web page generator recommended by Vicky Lai.
What can I say? I think I&amp;rsquo;m sold. This will at least serve as an excellent splash page before I get something more complex up and running with Flask. Maybe the two could even work well together?</description>
